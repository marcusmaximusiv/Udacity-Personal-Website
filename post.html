                    Tyler Herro has recently come off the bench and 
                    has had, since October 25th, a game where he has scored 
                    10 points or more which we haven't seen from a player coming
                    off the bench in an extremely long time since James Harden
                    back when he came off the bench for the Oklahoma City Thunder.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This season especially he has been amazing at field goal percentage
                    jumping from 43.9% from the field this past season to 46% which means
                    he is finding his spots better and putting the ball in the basket when they count.
                </p>
                <p>                               
                    With 39.3% 3-point spot Herro is a danger from distance and that 
                    puts a lot of pressure on opponents because he is versatile as a shooter and off the ball
                    offensive weapon as well like he showed at his days at Memphis University. 
                    Each year his FG% and 3PT% get better and better to the point where i think he will
                    be a superstar talent in no time. 
                </p>
                <p>If you look at all the stats he keeps trending upwards in terms of effiency:</p>

                            Currently Tyler is having a career year with <b><u>3.8</u></b> Assists, 
                            his 3 point percentage being the <b><u>highest of his career</u></b>, 
                            his field goal percentage being the <b><u>highest of his career</u></b> and 
                            his point per game average being the <b><u>highest of his career</u></b>
                        </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Many critics this season have pointed out Tyler is "just a fad in the NBA" due to 
                    in some critics words "cirumstances and luck". Recently Tyler on a recent podcase 
                    felt he needed to be in the rising stars conversation. Here were his words exactly:
                </p>
                <blockquote>Luka, Trae, Ja..I feel like my name should be in that category too</blockquote>
                <p>
                    Tyler herro is proving every day that he is becoming the next Miami heat star and i expect
                    Nothing less from him moving forward in his career
